# FungiClassifier

## Overview
This reposistory contains the architecture specifications of an open-source semi-supervised machine learning fungus classification application. It is being developed for the enthusiast who wishes to learn about a given mushroom, whether that be in a controlled environment or out in the field.
The application takes user submitted photographs and verifies the genus and species using a neural network that is trained and tested using a large labeled dataset of mushrooms from the Mushroom Observer database. Our proposed model will be pretrained on ImageNet-21K and fined tuned on the mushroom database.
